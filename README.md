Student Management System
=========================
A console application coded in Python programming language that used ```csv``` as database for storing records. The main focus of this console app is to allow the users to manipulate student information stored in the database.  This project is a user-friendly application created to store and monitor student records conveniently. 

ü§î Overview
-------------
Our system handles records with the aid of the following sources:
1. This project uses ```csv``` as database. The imported database writes data in the format preferred by ```Excel```.
2. ```operator``` module: Used to sort all student records stored in our database.

> The csv database is obtained from importing the csv module by ```import csv``` to create the databases that we use: ```students.csv``` and ```admin.csv```. It contains the student records managed by the Admin user and the login information of the admin. We used csv module‚Äôs ```reader``` and ```writer``` objects to read and write data from user and store it. Apart from this source that describe the SMS data, we also used the ```operator``` module, which is mainly used for sorting the records for easy viewing. It provides the method ```operator.itemgetter()``` to retrieve values on a specific field. In the program it is used as ```data = sorted(data, key=operator.itemgetter(1))``` to ```sort``` the stored data in our csv database.
